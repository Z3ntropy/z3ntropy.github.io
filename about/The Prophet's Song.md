# The Prophet's Song
An allegory by Chris Connor, loosely inspired by Queen's song of the same name.

---
*In a long forgotten city, three sisters were blessed by the Jade Emperor with perfect prophecy through song. Their harmonious predictions helped the Jade Emperor maintain order in the universe, pleasing him greatly. And so he bestowed the sisters with a meaningful life full of happiness. But one of the sisters discovered that if she altered the future's melody slightly, she could direct riches and wealth toward the sisters. Upon discovering this, the Jade Emperor bound the sisters' power. From then, their prophetic voices would become mute if they attempted to sing of a future that benefited themselves. Cursed with happiness, forever singing songs for the benefit of others.*
