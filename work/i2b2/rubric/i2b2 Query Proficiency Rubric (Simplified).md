## **Overview:**

I'd like your feedback on the "i2b2 Query Proficiency Rubric" I'm developing. The simplified version below provides a baseline framework that can be extended to measure the potential benefit of "AI Cell" features.

My goal is to ensure a solid foundation before sharing a more comprehensive version that includes assessment of AI assistance utility.  This initial version should be sufficient for you to assess the overall structure and approach.

Thanks for your help!
